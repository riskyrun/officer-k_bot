# officer-k_bot

## In one line


A simple python based telegram bot which uses AWS Textract to extract text . 

## Why I made this
I made this to help myself to transcript my handwritten patient histories into text.

Since most hospitals (including the hospital I work in ) have in-house computers,I wanted an easy way to convert handwriting to text and get it into the system only accessible from the workplace.

## Services used 
Main services used include text and handwriting recognition tool from AWS and I used telegram as the main interface to upload photos and download text.
Using telegram proved helpful because I could log on to my account in any browser without admin rights. 

## Instructions
> 1) Host the bot on your machine or any cloud server (I have mine on pythonanywhere too apart from the RPi)
> 2) Invite the bot to your group or start a one-on-one chat 
> 3) In the chat room, simply upload the photo you wish to upload
> 4) wait for the text to be bounced back to you 
> 5) copy the text and enjoy
